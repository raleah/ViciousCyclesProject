                Vicious Cycles Inc is a (your town)-based cycle workshop founded by a few like-minded individuals in late 2010. Our mechanics build the bikes and man the workshop. 
                Our customer service staff attends to the day-to-day operations. We hope to create and foster a strong passion for the local biking scene because each and every 
                one of us is a biking enthusiast. <br/> <br/> We believe that every machine should be an extension of its owner. We believe in the significance of individualism. We believe
                in the stories between your cycle and you. We believe in having fun. No matter the circumstances, we bike hard and we bike often.

        <h2>What makes us special?</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                When it comes to industry-leading innovations in cycles and accessories, Vicious Cycle products 
                are what you have been waiting for. We sell top-quality cycling equipment and have been doing it 
                for years. <br><br/>Our products have become the supply line of choice and lesser companies have been copying 
                us for some time. Don't be fooled by imitators, Vicious Cycles is the real deal. Don't settle for 
                second best when it comes to your cycling needs, but don't feel you have to raid your savings. Vicious 
                Cycle Products is a name you can put your trust in, at a price you can afford. <br><br/>Of course, custom work is 
                another thing entirely. At Vicious Cycles, we are not interested in a "Race to the Bottom" when it comes 
                to creating custom builds. If you're interested in discussing a fully custom or customized build, come down 
                to our store and visit with us to find out what we can really do.

            <p>
                At Vicious Cycles, we are committed to providing superior customer service and satisfaction. 
                Our staff will assist you every step of the way, from product selection and ordering to truly custom builds.
                <br><br/>We’ve been doing this whole custom thing for quite a while, and we've seen some ups and downs, we're loving 
                every moment of it. A proper custom build takes time, and we’ll work closely with you to get it right. From 
                stylish cycles to trusty monster rides, we’ve done them all. Talk with a member of our mechanic's team to discuss 
                your plan, and we'll see your dream realized.
